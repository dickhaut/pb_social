Known Problems
==============

If you are testing the extension locally, you may encounter some small problems:

- Facebook posts may not be loaded because of some xampp malconfiguration. You have two choices here:
  1. Update your ssl certificates (.cert files)
  2. Turn off ssl verification (considered as unsafe method because you'll send your credentials unencrypted)

- Posts without image may not load the placeholder image because of a 'Not allowed to load local resource' error.

- Depending on your Instagram developer app status, you may not be allowed to get data from other users. See the FAQ section for more information.
