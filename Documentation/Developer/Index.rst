Developer Corner
================

From developer to developer,

i have implemented you a dummy provider strain through the extension. If you want to add a provider, modify or clone it.
If you want to add some features or make some bugfixing ... ah never mind ... if you want to implement a feature read
my comments.

As you know comments are a very rare species, so be aware to not scare them. They also like to live among fellows. :)
