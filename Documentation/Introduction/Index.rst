Introduction
============

With this extension we decided to fill a gap of social media integration in typo3. Our Goal is it to provide an easy
and time-saving way of integrating and interacting with common social media platforms. As you know nothing is perfect
but we will give our best to make this extension as comfortable as you need it. For this we need your Feedback, so
if you need something or have something to say, don't hesitate to contact us. Either write us an email at info@plusb.de.

may the Force be with you


.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

It can display feeds from social media platforms in the way you like it. Maybe you want to get your
Facebook-Page content? No problem, set your Facebook-Credentials and Facebook-UserId and you're ready to go.
The Extension will do all the tricky authentication stuff and leave the relaxed part of making the result pretty to you.
